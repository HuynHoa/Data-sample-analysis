# Data sample analysis

Problem
- Estimate the purchase and replacement cost of the book collection in a library for insurance purposes.


Data collection
- Source: books.csv provided in Sampling course
- Sample randomly a number of shelves and books using two-stage cluster sampling method.
- First stage: select 12 shelves among 44 shelves
- Second stage: sample 5 books among M<sub>i</sub> books on each selected shelf (M<sub>i</sub> is the total number of books on each selected shelf)

Data analysis
- Read the books data from csv file
- Extract the replacement cost of each shelf and draw a side-by-side boxplot graph to compare the means of replacement costs on each shelf
- Estimate the total replacement cost for the library using the mean of average cost per shelf and the number of books per shelf.
- Estimate the average replacement cost per book using the total value of cost per shelf and the sum of number of books on each selected shelf M<sub>i</sub>.
